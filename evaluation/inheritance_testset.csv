591 CASES OF INCAPACITY
Any person who has not been declared incapacitated by law can dispose by will.
Incapable of testing are:
1) those who have not attained the age of majority;
2) those who are interdicted by reason of insanity;
3) those who, although not interdicted, are proved to have been, for any cause, even transitory, incapable of making a will at the time they made the will.
In the cases of incapacity provided for in this article, the will may be challenged by anyone who has an interest in it.
The action shall be prescribed within five years from the day on which the testamentary provisions were executed.
 
","If someone made a will while they were temporarily incapacitated due to illness or injury, but have since recovered, can their will still be challenged under this law?","Yes, according to the context, if someone made a will while they were temporarily incapacitated (even due to a transitory cause), their will can still be challenged under this law. The fact that they have since recovered does not preclude a challenge to the will. Additionally, anyone with an interest in the will can bring such a challenge within five years from the day the will was executed.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 591', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

ARTICLE 664 FULFILLMENT OF THE LEGACY OF KIND
In the legacy of a thing determined only in kind, the choice, when not entrusted by the testator to the legatee or to a third party, rests with the honoree. The latter is obliged to give things of no less than average quality; but if there is only one of the things belonging to the genus specified in the estate, the honoree has no right nor can he be obliged to lend another, unless the testator expressly provides otherwise.
If the choice is left by the testator to the legatee or a third party, they must choose a thing of average quality; but if things of the kind indicated are found in the estate, the legatee might choose the best.
If the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made in accordance with the third paragraph of ART631 (If the honored person or the third party can not or will not make the choice, it shall be made by decree by the president of the court of the place where the succession was opened, after taking appropriate information.).

","What happens if the testator leaves the choice of a legacy item to the legatee, but there are multiple items of varying quality in the estate - can the legatee choose any one of them, or are they limited to choosing an item of average quality?","If the testator leaves the choice of a legacy item to the legatee and there are multiple items of varying quality in the estate, the legatee is allowed to choose the best item among those found in the estate. However, if no items of the specified kind are found in the estate, or if the instruction was to choose from outside the estate, the legatee must choose an item of average quality.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 664', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

476 TACIT ACCEPTANCE
Acceptance is tacit when the successor performs an act which necessarily presupposes his willingness to accept and which he would not have the right to do but in the capacity of heir.

","What types of actions or behaviors would be considered as implying tacit acceptance of an inheritance under Italian law, and how can it be determined if a particular action demonstrates a successor's willingness to accept the inheritance?","Under Italian law, tacit acceptance of an inheritance occurs when the successor performs an act that necessarily implies their willingness to accept the inheritance. Such acts would include those that the successor would not have the right to do unless they were acting as the heir. 

To determine if a particular action demonstrates a successor's willingness to accept the inheritance, it must be evaluated whether the action presupposes the successor's acceptance of the role of heir and whether they would legally be entitled to perform such an act only in that capacity. Essentially, any behavior or decision that can only be justified by the assumption that the person is acting as the heir could be considered tacit acceptance.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 476', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

505 FORFEITURE OF BENEFIT
The heir, who, in case of opposition, does not observe the rules established in ART498 or does not complete the liquidation or graduation status within the term established in ART500, forfeits the benefit of inventory.
Similarly, an heir who, in the case provided for in ART503, after the invitation to creditors to submit statements of claim, makes payments before the liquidation procedure is finalized or fails to observe the time limit set for him under ART500 forfeits the benefit of inventory.
Forfeiture does not occur when it concerns payments to preferential or mortgage creditors.
In any case, forfeiture of the benefit of inventory can be asserted only by the deceased's creditors and legatees.

",What happens if an heir makes a payment to a non-preferential creditor before the liquidation procedure is finalized - will they automatically forfeit their right to the benefit of inventory?,"Yes, according to the context, if an heir makes payments to non-preferential creditors before the liquidation procedure is finalized, they will forfeit the benefit of inventory.

460 POWERS OF THE SUCCESSOR BEFORE ACCEPTANCE
The successor may exercise possessory actions to protect the property of the estate, without the need for material apprehension.
He may also perform acts of conservatorship, supervision and temporary administration, and he may be authorized by the court to sell property that cannot be preserved or whose preservation involves serious expense.
The successor may not perform the acts indicated in the preceding paragraphs when a receiver of the estate has been appointed pursuant to ART528.
 
","What specific actions can I take as a successor to protect and manage the estate before I officially accept the inheritance, and are there any limitations or restrictions on my authority?","As a successor, you can exercise possessory actions to protect the property of the estate without needing to demonstrate material apprehension. Additionally, you can perform acts of conservatorship, supervision, and temporary administration.

ALIENATION OF INHERITED PROPERTY WITHOUT AUTHORISATION The heir forfeits the benefit of inventory if he alienates or subjects to pledge or mortgage hereditary property, or transacts with respect to such property without judicial authorization and without observing the forms prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.
For movable property, the authorization is not necessary after five years have elapsed since the declaration of acceptance with benefit of inventory.
 
","What happens if I sell or give away an inherited item within 5 years of accepting the inheritance, without getting judicial authorization - will I lose my right to the benefit of inventory?","If you alienate (sell, give away, etc.) inherited property, including movable property, within 5 years of accepting the inheritance without judicial authorization, yes, you will forfeit the benefit of inventory.

Legacies made as remuneration for services rendered to the testator are valid, even if the object or quantity is not indicated.

","""What happens if someone is left a legacy 'as they see fit' in a will - is that considered a valid inheritance under Italian law?""","No, it's not valid.

651 LEGATE OF THING OF THE LEGATEE OR OF A THIRD PARTY
A legacy of the thing of the honored person or of a third party is null, unless it appears from the will or other statement in writing by the testator that he knew that the thing legated belonged to the honored person or to the third party. In the latter case, the honoree is obliged to acquire ownership of the thing from the third party and to transfer it to the legatee, but it is within his power to pay the legatee a fair price for it.
If, however, the thing legated, although belonging to others at the time of the will, is in the testator's ownership at the time of his death, the legacy is valid.

","What happens if the testator did not know that the thing they were leaving as a legacy belonged to someone else, and it still belongs to that person at the time of the testator's death?","The legacy is null.

556 DETERMINATION OF THE DISPOSABLE PORTION
In order to determine the amount of the portion that the deceased was entitled to dispose of, a mass is formed of all the property that belonged to the deceased at the time of his death, deducting his debts. The assets that were disposed of by way of gift are then fictitiously combined, according to their value determined in accordance with the rules dictated in Articles 747 to 750, and on the estate thus formed the share that the deceased was entitled to dispose of is calculated.

 The provisions of the first paragraph also apply in cases of a person being investigated for voluntary or attempted murder against one or both parents, brother or sister.
 The prosecutor, consistent with the requirements of secrecy of the investigation,  without delay notifies the clerk's office of the court in the district in which the succession was opened of the fact that it has been entered in the register of criminal records, for the purpose of suspension under this Article.

The legatee, however, must apply to the legatee for possession of the thing legated, even when he/she has been expressly dispensed from it by the testator.

The text states that ""the ownership or right shall be transmitted from the testator to the legatee at the time of the testator's death"", which means that the legacy is acquired automatically upon the testator's death, without the need for acceptance. However, it also states that the legatee ""must apply to the [executor?] for possession of the thing legated"" in order to obtain physical possession of it.

The paper on which the dispositions are laid out or that which serves as a wrapper must be sealed with imprint, so that the will cannot be opened or extracted without breakage or alteration.
The testator, in the presence of two witnesses, personally delivers to the notary the paper so sealed, or shall have it sealed in the manner aforesaid in the presence of the notary and the witnesses, and declares that in this paper is contained his will. The testator, if he is mute or deaf, (1) writes such declaration in the presence of witnesses and also declare in writing that he has read the will, if it has been written by others.
On the paper in which the will is written or wrapped by the testator, or on an additional wrapper prepared by the notary and duly sealed by him, the deed of receipt is written in which the fact of delivery and the declaration of the testator, the number and imprint of the seals, and the assistance of the witnesses to all formalities is indicated.
The deed must be signed by the testator, the witnesses, and the notary public.
If the testator cannot, for any impediment, sign the deed of delivery, what is established about a will by public instrument is observed. All this must be done in succession and without passing to other acts.

560 REDUCTION OF LEGACY OR DONATION OF REAL PROPERTY
When the object of the legacy or donation to be reduced is real estate, the reduction is made by separating from the real property itself the part needed to supplement the reserved share, if this can be done conveniently.
If the separation cannot be done conveniently and the legatee or donee has in the real property a surplus greater than one-fourth of the available portion, the real property must be left in full in the inheritance, subject to the right to obtain the value of the available portion. If the surplus does not exceed one-fourth, the legatee or donee may retain all of the property, compensating the legitimates in money.
The legatee or donee who is a legitimary may retain all of the property, provided that the value of the property does not exceed the amount of the available portion and the share he is entitled to as a legitimary.

",What happens if I'm a beneficiary of a legacy or donation of real property and my share exceeds the reserved share - do I have to give up part of the property or can I compensate the other heirs in money?,"According to the context, if you're a legatee or donee and your surplus (the amount exceeding the reserved share) is greater than one-fourth of the available portion, you cannot compensate the other heirs in money by giving up only part of the property. In this case, the real property must be left in full in the inheritance, subject to the right to obtain the value of the available portion.

However, if your surplus does not exceed one-fourth of the available portion, you may retain all of the property and compensate the other heirs (the legitimates) in money. 

Additionally, if you are a legitimary (a beneficiary who is also an heir), you may retain all of the property without compensating the other heirs in money, as long as the value of the property does not exceed the amount of the available portion and the share you are entitled to as a legitimary.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 560', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

Within one month of the entry, the declaration must be transcribed by the clerk of the court in the place where the succession was opened.
The declaration must be preceded or followed by the inventory, in the form prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure.

The thing legated, with all its appurtenances, shall be lent to the legatee in the state in which it is at the time of the testator's death.

If the bequeathed estate has been increased by subsequent purchases, these are due to the legatee, provided that they are contiguous to the estate and form an economic unit with it.

","What happens if the testator sells or modifies part of the bequeathed estate after making the will, but before their death - is the legatee still entitled to receive the original thing legated in its entirety?","According to the context provided, if the testator transforms the thing legated into another, so that it loses its former form and primitive name, the legatee is still entitled to receive the transformed thing. However, if the testator sells part of the bequeathed estate, the context does not explicitly address this situation.

But, regarding modifications, it can be inferred from the second paragraph that if the testator modifies or transforms the thing legated before their death, the legatee will receive the modified or transformed thing, as long as the modification is subject to the applicability of the second paragraph of ART 686 (the details of which are not provided in the context).

It's also mentioned that if the bequeathed estate has been increased by subsequent purchases, these are due to the legatee if they are contiguous and form an economic unit with it. However, this does not directly address the sale or reduction of the original estate.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it seems the legatee may still receive the thing legated, but in its modified form, if it has been transformed before the testator's death.

Outside this case, non-separating creditors and legatees may compete with those who have exercised separation; but, if part of the estate has not been separated the value of this is added to the price of the separated property to determine how much would be due to each of the competitors, and is then considered to have been attributed in full to the non-separating creditors and legatees.

As for alternative arrangements, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, common alternatives include:

1. **Mirror Wills**: Each of you creates a separate will that mirrors the other's, leaving assets to each other or to the same beneficiaries. This way, while the wills are not joint, they reflect a mutual agreement on how your estates should be distributed.

2. **Separate Wills with Similar Provisions**: Similar to mirror wills, but you have the flexibility to make different provisions if needed. Each spouse would have their own will, and while many of the provisions might be identical, there's room for individual variations.

3. **Trusts**: Setting up a trust can also achieve similar goals to a joint will. A trust allows you to place assets into it during your lifetime or through your will, with instructions on how those assets should be distributed after your death. Trusts can be particularly useful for managing property, avoiding probate, and ensuring privacy.

4. **Community Property Agreements**: Depending on where you live, community property agreements might be an option. These agreements allow spouses to hold property together during their lifetimes and can simplify the transfer of property upon the death of one spouse.

5. **Consulting with an Estate Planning Attorney**: Given the complexity and variability of estate laws from one jurisdiction to another, consulting with an attorney specializing in estate planning is highly recommended.

It is deemed as not affixed to an universa provision the term from which the effect of a universal provision is to begin or cease.

","What exactly does ""universa provision"" refer to in the context of Italian inheritance law, and how does the concept of a term affect its application?","In this context, ""universa provision"" likely refers to a general or comprehensive provision, possibly related to inheritance or succession. The term ""term"" seems to indicate a specific point in time or a condition that triggers the start or end of the effect of this universal provision.

According to the provided text, if a term is specified as the starting or ending point of a universal provision, it is not considered to be an integral part of that provision. In other words, the term serves as a trigger or a boundary for the application of the universal provision, but it is not deemed to be affixed to or inherent in the provision itself.

Therefore, the concept of a term affects the application of a universal provision by defining its scope and duration, while remaining distinct from the provision's core content.

695 RIGHTS OF THE PERSONAL CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTED PERSON
The personal creditors of the instituted person might act only on the fruits of the property that is the subject of substitution.

","What exactly are considered ""fruits"" of the property in this context, and how do they differ from the property itself for the purposes of satisfying the claims of the personal creditors?","The provided context does not explicitly define what is meant by ""fruits"" of the property. However, based on general legal principles, ""fruits"" typically refer to the income, produce, or profits derived from a property, as opposed to the property itself. This can include rents, dividends, interest, crops, or other forms of revenue generated by the property.

In this context, the distinction between the ""fruits"" and the property itself is crucial for determining what personal creditors of the instituted person can claim. The personal creditors are limited to acting on the fruits of the property, which implies they can only seek satisfaction from the income or profits produced by the property, rather than the property's capital value or the property itself.

For example, if the property in question is a piece of land used for farming, the ""fruits"" would be the crops harvested from that land. If it's an investment property, the ""fruits"" could be the rental income it generates. Personal creditors could potentially claim these incomes to satisfy their debts but would not have a claim on the land or the investment itself.

This distinction protects the property's capital value for other purposes (possibly for the instituted person's heirs or for other legal obligations) while allowing personal creditors some recourse for debt repayment from the income generated by the property.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 695', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

This provision does not apply when the testator has expressly granted the legatee, the right to request the supplement.
The legacy in lieu of the legitimacy is borne by the unavailable portion. If, however, the value of the legacy exceeds that of the legitimacy due to the legitimary, for the excess the legacy is borne by the available portion.
 
",What happens if I waive the legacy and claim my legitimacy instead - do I still have any rights or claims to the assets or property that were part of the original legacy?,"According to the context provided, if you waive the legacy and claim your legitimacy instead, it simply means you are choosing to claim your rightful inheritance (legitimacy) rather than accepting the alternative gift (legacy) left to you.

It only mentions the trade-off between the legacy and the legitimacy, and potential supplements if the legacy's value is less than the legitimacy's.

The donee on his part is obligated for deteriorations that, through his fault, have diminished the value of the property.
A coheir who contributes property in kind might retain possession of it until the actual reimbursement of the sums due to him for expenses and improvements.

","What happens if a coheir makes improvements to an inherited property, but another coheir causes deterioration to the same property - how are these conflicting claims settled under Italian inheritance law?","Under the provided context, if a coheir makes improvements to an inherited property and another coheir causes deterioration to the same property, their claims would be settled as follows:

1. The value of the improvements made by the first coheir must be deducted in their favor, up to the limits of their value at the time of the open succession.
2. The second coheir is obligated for the deteriorations that have diminished the value of the property, but only if the deterioration was caused through their fault.

In essence, the first coheir would be reimbursed for the improvements they made, while the second coheir would be responsible for compensating for any deterioration they caused. This suggests a principle of accounting for both positive and negative changes to the property's value during the period of co-ownership or management, with each coheir being held accountable for their respective actions that affected the property's condition and value.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 748', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

","What exactly is meant by ""dispensation from collation"" and how can a deceased person effectively dispense their heirs from contributing to collation in an Italian inheritance?","According to the context, ""dispensation from collation"" refers to the act of a deceased person exempting their heirs (children, descendants, or spouse) from contributing to the coheirs all that they have received by donation directly or indirectly. In other words, it's a waiver that releases the heir from the obligation to add what they received as a gift during the deceased's lifetime to the inheritance.

715 CASES OF IMPEDIMENT TO DIVISION
If there is a conceived person among those called to the succession, the division cannot take place before the birth of that person. Likewise, the division might not take place during the pendency of a judgment on the filiation of the person who, in the event of a favorable outcome of the judgment, would be called to succeed, nor might it take place during the conduct of the administrative procedure for the admission of the recognition provided for in the fourth paragraph of ART252 or for the recognition of the entity established as heir. (1)
However, the judicial authority might authorize the division, setting appropriate precautions.
The provision of the preceding paragraph shall also apply if there are unborn unconceived children among those called to the estate.
If unborn unconceived children are instituted without determination of shares, the judicial authority might allocate all or part of the hereditary property to the other coheirs, according to the circumstances, ordering appropriate precautions in the interest of the unborn children.

","What happens if a potential heir is conceived but not yet born when the division of an inheritance is being considered - can the division still proceed, and what protections are in place for the rights of the unborn child?","According to the context, if there is a conceived person among those called to the succession, the division cannot take place before the birth of that person. However, the judicial authority may authorize the division, setting appropriate precautions to protect the rights of the unborn child.

This means that the foundation is only liable for the debts and obligations associated with the inheritance up to the value of the assets received. Accepting ""with the benefit of inventory"" protects the foundation's interests by limiting its liability to the extent of the inherited assets, thereby shielding its other assets from potential claims or debts related to the inheritance.

RELEASE OF PROPERTY TO CREDITORS AND LEGATEES
The heir, not later than one month after the expiration of the time limit set for submitting statements of claim, if he has not carried out any act of liquidation, may release all the property of the estate for the benefit of creditors and legatees.

From the time the declaration of release is transcribed, acts of disposition of the hereditary property performed by the heir are without effect with respect to creditors and legatees.
The heir must deliver the property to the liquidator appointed in accordance with the rules of the following article. Upon delivery, he is released from all liability for the debts of the estate.

2) one who has committed, to the detriment of one of such persons, an act to which the [Criminal] Law (1) declares the provisions on murder applicable;
3) Whoever has denounced one of such persons for a crime punishable by life imprisonment or imprisonment for a term of not less in the minimum term than three years, if the denunciation has been declared slanderous in criminal court; or who has testified against the same persons accused of the aforesaid crimes, if the testimony has been declared, with respect to him, false in criminal court;
3-bis) Who, having been forfeited from parental authority in respect of the person whose succession is involved, has not been reinstated in parental authority on the date of the opening of the succession of the same. 
4) Whoever has maliciously or violently induced the person, whose succession is at issue, to make, revoke or change the will, or has prevented him from doing so;
5) who has suppressed, concealed or altered the will by which the succession would be governed;
6) who has formed a false will or knowingly made use of it.

","What are the specific circumstances under which a person can be deemed unworthy to inherit according to Italian law, and how do these circumstances affect their rights to the inheritance?","According to the provided context, a person can be deemed unworthy to inherit under Italian law in the following specific circumstances:

1. **Willful killing or attempt**: If they have willfully killed or attempted to kill the person whose succession is in question, or their spouse, descendant, or ascendant, unless there are grounds that exclude punishability under criminal law.

2. **Acts akin to murder**: If they have committed acts against these individuals that the Criminal Law considers equivalent to murder.

3. **Slanderous denunciation or false testimony**: If they have denounced one of these persons for a serious crime (life imprisonment or at least three years' imprisonment) and the denunciation was found to be slanderous, or if they testified falsely against them in such cases.

3-bis. **Forfeiture of parental authority without reinstatement**: If they were forfeited from parental authority regarding the person whose succession is involved and had not been reinstated by the time the succession opened.

4. **Interference with will-making**: If they maliciously or violently induced the person to make, revoke, or change their will, or prevented them from doing so.

5. **Suppression, concealment, or alteration of a will**: If they suppressed, concealed, or altered the will that would govern the succession.

6. **Formation or use of a false will**: If they formed a false will or knowingly used one.

Waiver of inheritance is made by declaration, received by a notary  or the clerk of the court of the district (1) in which the succession was opened, and entered in the register of inheritances.
A waiver made gratuitously in favor of all those to whom the waiverer's share would have devolved does not take effect until, by any of the parties, the forms specified in the preceding paragraph are observed.
 
","What is the process for formally recording a waiver of inheritance in Italy, and what are the necessary steps to ensure that it takes effect?","To formally record a waiver of inheritance, a declaration must be made and received by either a notary or the clerk of the court of the district where the succession was opened. This declaration must then be entered into the register of inheritances. For a gratuitous waiver (one made without receiving anything in return) to take effect, one of the parties involved must observe these specified forms. Essentially, the process involves:

1. Making a declaration of waiver.
2. Having this declaration received by a notary or the clerk of the court in the relevant district.
3. Ensuring the declaration is entered into the register of inheritances.

By following these steps, the waiver of inheritance can be formally and legally recorded, ensuring it takes effect as intended.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 519', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

Testamentary dispositions, whatever the expression or name used by the testator, are universal in title and confer the status of heir if they include the universality or a share of the testator's property. Other dispositions are of a particular title and confer the status of legatee.
The indication of specific property or a complex of property does not exclude that the disposition is universal in title, when it appears that the testator intended to assign those properties as a share of the estate.

Although the will specifies particular properties (the house and its contents), it can be inferred that the testator intended to assign these properties as a share of their estate, potentially implying that they comprise the entirety or a significant portion of the testator's property. The fact that no other assets or properties are mentioned suggests that the testator may have intended for this individual to receive the bulk of their estate, which would be consistent with a universal disposition.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 588', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

The will indicates the place, date of receipt and time of signing, and shall be signed by the testator, the witnesses and the notary public. If the testator cannot sign, or can do so only with grave difficulty, he or she must state the cause, and the notary must mention this statement before reading the deed.
For the will of the mute or deaf, the rules established by the Notary Law for public deeds of these persons are observed. If the testator is also incapable of reading, four witnesses must attend.
 
","What happens if the person making the will (the testator) is unable to sign the document, and what additional steps need to be taken in this situation?","If the testator cannot sign, or can do so only with grave difficulty, they must state the cause of their inability to sign. The notary public must then mention this statement in the will before reading the deed. This ensures that the reason for the testator's inability to sign is formally recorded.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 603', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

758 GUARANTEE BETWEEN CO-HEIRS
Coheirs owe each other a guarantee for only harassment and eviction arising from a cause prior to the division.
The guarantee does not take place, if it has been excluded by an express clause in the deed of division, or if the coheir suffers the eviction through his own fault.

","What happens if one co-heir is evicted from a shared inheritance due to a cause that arose before the division, but it's unclear whether the eviction was due to their own fault or not - how would the guarantee between co-heirs apply in such a situation?","According to the context provided, if one co-heir is evicted from a shared inheritance due to a cause that arose before the division, but it's unclear whether the eviction was due to their own fault or not, then the guarantee between co-heirs would apply. The guarantee would cover harassment and eviction arising from a cause prior to the division, unless it has been excluded by an express clause in the deed of division. However, if it is later determined that the coheir suffered the eviction through their own fault, then the guarantee would not take place. In other words, the burden would be on the co-heirs to determine whether the eviction was due to the fault of the evicted co-heir, and if so, the guarantee would not apply.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 758', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

522 DEVOLUTION IN LEGITIMATE SUCCESSIONS.
In legitimate successions, the portion of one who renounces accrues to those who would have concurred with the renouncer, subject to the right of representation and subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of ART571.

622 COMMUNICATION OF WILLS TO THE COURT
The notary public shall transmit to the clerk's office of the court, in whose jurisdiction the succession was opened, a copy on plain paper of the records provided for in Articles 620 and 621 and of the public will.

","What is the purpose of transmitting a copy of the will to the court, and what are the consequences if the notary public fails to do so?","The context does not explicitly state the purpose or consequences. It only states that the notary public ""shall transmit"" a copy of the records, including the will, to the clerk's office of the court, indicating that it is a required action, but it does not provide information on why this transmission is necessary or what happens if the notary public fails to do so.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 620, 621', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

 636 PROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE
A condition that prevents first marriages or further marriages is unlawful.
However, the legatee of usufruct or use, habitation or pension, or other periodic benefit for the case or time of celibacy or widowhood, can only enjoy it during celibacy or widowhood.

","If I'm set to receive a periodic benefit from an inheritance as long as I remain unmarried, what happens to my right to that benefit if I get married?","According to the context provided, if you get married, you will no longer be able to enjoy the periodic benefit from the inheritance, as it is conditional on your remaining celibate (unmarried).","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 636', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"

714 SEPARATE ENJOYMENT OF PART OF THE PROPERTY
Division might be requested even when one or more coheirs have separately enjoyed part of the hereditary property, unless usury has occurred as a result of exclusive possession.

","What constitutes ""usury"" in the context of separate enjoyment of inherited property, and how is it determined whether usury has occurred due to exclusive possession?","The provided context does not define what constitutes ""usury"" in this specific scenario, nor does it outline the criteria for determining whether usury has occurred due to exclusive possession. It only mentions that division might be requested unless usury has occurred as a result of exclusive possession, without elaborating on the specifics of usury in this context.","{'civil_codes_used': 'Art. 714', 'law': 'Inheritance', 'type': 'ITALY'}"
